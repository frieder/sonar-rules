<p>
    Whenever a return value of a method is annotated as potentially <code>@Nullable</code> consider using
    <code>java.util.Optional</code> or <code>io.vavr.control.Option</code> instead to reduce the risk of a
    possible NPE. <br/>
    When such a return type is not applicable at least make sure that null is handled properly.
